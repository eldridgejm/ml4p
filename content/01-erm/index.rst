Empirical Risk Minimization
===========================

One way to think of machine learning is through the lens of *optimization*. Here, we're
trying to "fit" a model to data. This is done by minimizing a loss function, which
measure how well the model fits the data. In this part, we'll introduce the basic
machinery of optimization, and show how it can be used to fit models to data.
